# JEDI KNIGHT GALAXIES: ext_data

Jedi Knight Galaxies is easily the most moddable mod for Jedi Academy in existence. Part of this is due to the new systems we implemented with the ext_data files. Almost of them follow JSON syntax.

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

1. Understanding the data structures
2. Understanding treasure classes
3. Global tables
4. Item fields
5. Armor fields
6. Weapon fields
7. Ammo fields
8. Jetpack fields
9. Teams ("Gang Wars") fields
10. Lightsabers - Hilts and Stances


## UNDERSTANDING THE DATA STRUCTURES

Note that in this document we are talking about the JSON files only. That is, we are only talking about the stuff in the following directories:

- ammo
- armor
- gangwars
- hilts
- items
- jetpacks
- stances
- tables
- treasure
- weapons

The other directories (MP, vehicles, sabers, NPCs) are files that are included by the base game. Those are deprecated and will be replaced later on.

Fields have a type associated with them:
 - integer: means that this can only be whole numbers, -2billion to 2billion
 - float: means that this can be decimal numbers
 - boolean: means that this can be only true or false
 - string: means that this can have words, letters, etc, enclosed in quotation marks ""
 - array of (type): means that this contains multiple values
 - object: a JSON object which has further values below it

Fields are not case sensitive.
If a string field starts with a @, that means it will be looked for in the .str files. For instance @JKG_INVENTORY_MOD_UNKNOWN will be looked for as:
 - jkg.str, looking for INVENTORY_MOD_UNKNOWN
 - jkg_inventory.str, looking for MOD_UNKNOWN
 - jkg_inventory_mod.str, looking for UNKNOWN

## UNDERSTANDING TREASURE CLASSES

Treasure classes are a form of randomization for items. Vendors, treasure chests, and NPCs are (or will) be hooked up to use them.

Each treasure class file (in /treasure/) has a series of treasure classes in them, under the object "classes". There are a few important fields in the class:

 - numberPicksMin (integer): When this treasure class is used, the minimum number of items that will be picked
 - numberPicksMax (integer): When this treasure class is used, the maximum number of items that will be picked
 - uniquePicks (boolean, optional): If true, this treasure class will not pick two of the same item
 - picks (object): The list of items or treasure classes to pick

Note that if uniquePicks is true, the total number of objects that this treasure class can pick MUST exceed numberPicksMax, otherwise the server will crash!

Picks is a series of fields that have integer values associated with them. The field names can point to either internal item names, or other treasure classes. Again, be careful! If you loop back to a treasure class, it is possible to crash the server!

So how do we evaluate the odds of getting an item? Well, you can use the `tceval` command ingame, which will "drop" items in the treasure class and calculate the odds for you using empirical analysis. But this is best shown via example:

Let's say we have a treasure class, "myclass". It has two picks: "pistol" with odds 1, and "grenade" with odds 3. Pistol has a 1/4 chance of dropping, and Grenade has a 3/4 chance of dropping. The numerator is the odds as listed in the field, and the denominator is the total odds added up.

With nested treasure classes, this gets a bit more complicated. Let's have another treasure class, "myfancyclass". It has "myclass" with odds 2, and "rifle" with odds 2. The rifle has a 50% chance of dropping, and it has a 50% chance to pick from "myclass". That means in total, Pistol has a 1/8 chance of dropping, and grenades have a 3/8 chance of dropping, while Rifle has a 4/8 chance of dropping.


## GLOBAL TABLES

## AMMO FIELDS

.ammo files can contain multiple types of ammo. Ammo can be based on other types of ammo. Usually a weapon will require a base type, but supplies either the same base type of ammo by default, or a different one which is more specialized for it.

In these files, there is a special kind of type called a complexAmmo type. complexAmmo comes in two varieties: complexAmmoFloat (for floating point/decimal values) and complexAmmoInteger (for integer values)
complexAmmo are an object with the following fields:
 - set (either integer or float): If present, sets the override to some specific value.
 - add (either integer or float): If present, either adds to the value (if positive) or subtracts (if negative)
 - multiply (float): If present, multiplies the value by a specific amount.

Here is an example of how complexAmmo types look in the files:
```
	"damage": {
		"add": 5
	}
```
This example would add 5 extra damage to each shot by the weapon. If we used "set" instead of "add", it would set the damage to 5. If we used "multiply" instead of "add", it would multiply the damage by 5.

Each object in the ammo file is the linkage name for it, and they can contain the following fields:

 - shortname (string): The short name of the ammo, to show on the HUD.
 - basedOn (string, optional): The ammo that this type is based on.
 - max (integer): Maximum amount that the player can carry.
 - pricePerUnit (float): Number of credits that one of these is worth.
